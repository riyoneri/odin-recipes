    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Black-eyed pea patties made with bacon, shallots, and roasted red peppers are pan-fried until golden brown and crispy.
        This recipe calls for canned peas, but for more flavor, I sometimes use leftover peas that I cooked with ham hocks or
        smoked turkey from New Year's.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound bacon</li>
        <li>3 cups canned black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped roasted red peppers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
            Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mash black-eyed peas in a bowl with a fork. Crumble bacon into the bowl, then stir in red peppers and shallot. Stir in
            enough flour to make the mixture stick together. Season with salt and pepper and form into four equal patties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat until butter melts. Add patties and cook until golden brown and
            crispy, about 4 minutes per side.
        </li>
    </ol>

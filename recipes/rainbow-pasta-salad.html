    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Pasta salad is a staple for any picnic or outdoor gathering. This is an easy salad to prepare and share with friends and
        family, going with just about anything on your menu. Keep it cool with fresh cold cucumbers. I usually add olives to my
        pasta salad for a salty, briny bite.

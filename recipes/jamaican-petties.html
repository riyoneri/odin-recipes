    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        When you're playing outdoor games and need a snack, these beef patties do just the trick. These handheld
        pastries are
        stuffed with savory ground beef and spices for a flavorful kick found even in the dough
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup shortening</li>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare pastry: Combine flour, curry powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in margarine and shortening until mixture resembles
            coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Shape dough into a log and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll
            each piece into a 6-inch circle (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare filling: Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion until soft and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
            Stir in ground beef; season with curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until beef is evenly
            browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed; remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle. Fold over and press edges together, making a half-circle. Use
            the back of a fork to seal edges, then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
